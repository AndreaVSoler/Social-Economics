This paper defines how socioeconomic characteristics, perspectives on future job, and the personal traits
of adolescents could shape their opinion about the relevance of children to be happy in life. To answer this
question, we use the youth questionnaire included in the last release of the SOEP Dataset which involves
17-year-old respondents. By using a two-part model, we provide an analysis that aims to predict two main
aspects: first, by a binary choice model, how the above-mentioned features influence adolescents to be
capable to have an opinion on whether having children is necessary to be happy in life; then, conditional
on the individuals that expressed an opinion, we modeled an ordered specification so that we can estimate
which are the personal attributes that shapes the personality of a teenage that considers own kids are needed
to feel fulfilled. Our findings suggest that, rather than the socioeconomic characteristics, what contributes
the most are the career perspective together with the personality traits of the individuals. We contribute
to the academic literature explaining the connection between childbearing expectations and happiness with
a specific focus on teenagers with specific demographic characteristics, specially in an European context of
descendent fertility since 1960.
